                                 Personally though, I consider my time in college as my most valuable experience.
                                First, my experience in college has given me a chance to sharpen my skills in my field of choice.
                                There have been, and there will continue to be, many opportunities to learn more ways of improving 
                                my craft as a result of my time in school, which I am truly thankful for.
