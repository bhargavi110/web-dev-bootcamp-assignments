                 Prim's algorithm to find minimum cost spanning tree (as Kruskal's algorithm) uses the greedy approach.
                 Prim's algorithm shares a similarity with the shortest path first algorithms. Prim's algorithm, in 
                 contrast with Kruskal's algorithm, treats the nodes as a single tree and keeps on adding new nodes
                 to the spanning tree from the given graph. Prim's algorithm to find minimum cost spanning tree.
